When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

Whenever I want the security of having a remote backup or when I work/ or intend to 
work with multiple people.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Manually pulling changes down, would ensure that you have an oppotunity to vet changes before adding them to 
the local repository.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

A clone is a second repository made by copying the first one. A fork is a clone made on the github
server, cloning an existing repository. A branch is an alternative path made in a repository to 
possibly test a new feature without affecting the main program.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

It helps act as a guide. Instructing as to whether the two repositories are in the same
state, or which one is ahead of the other. It would be useful for short periods spent
offline. It can be thrown off however, when collaborating.
